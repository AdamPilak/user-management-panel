          Hello, my name is Adam Pilak here is my completed project from the
          recruitment task for Junior Frontend Developer position. Users table
          alone seemed a little bit to easy so I added routing with working
          mobile navigation and besides filtering I also added sorting by name.
          The page is fully responsive and states like loading and errors are
          handled.

      </div>
    </section>

export default Home;
